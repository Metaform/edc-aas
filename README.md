# Technical Specification for Applying DSP Usage Control to AAS data

This contents of this repository are a technical specification for enabling DSP usage control with AAS. Its goals are to define an AAS-DSP integration that:

1. Codifies best-practices for modelling AAS submodels as DSP datasets.
2. Promotes network-wide interoperability by defining how DSP datasets and endpoint information is conveyed in AAS submodel descriptors.

It is **not** a goal of this specification to address syntactic or semantic interoperability of AAS submodels.

The technical specification is devided into the following documents:

1. [An Introduction](introduction.md) outlining the main technical concepts
2. [A Specification](specification.md) detailing normative technical requirements
