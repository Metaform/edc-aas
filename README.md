# Technical Specification for Applying IDS Usage Control to AAS data

This contents of this repository are a technical specification for enabling IDS usage control with AAS. Its goals are to define an AAS-IDS integration that:

1. Codifies best-practices for modelling AAS submodels as IDS datasets.
2. Promotes network-wide interoperability by defining how IDS datasets and endpoint information is conveyed in AAS submodel descriptors.

It is **not** a goal of this specification to address syntactic or semantic interoperability of AAS submodels.

The technical specification is devided into the following documents:

1. [An Introduction](introduction.md) outlining the main technical concepts
2. [An Specification](specification.md) detailing normative technical requirements
